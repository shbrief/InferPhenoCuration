### LR_RF_train_on_combined.qmd    
+ Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF) models trained on the combined
TCGA datasets (i.e., cancer samples from COAD, STAD, and UCEC)    
+ Split train and test datasets considering the class proportions (i.e., MSI vs. MSS)    

### RF_train_on_coad.qmd
+ Random Forest (RF) models trained on the TCGA-COAD cancer samples, and tested
on cancer samples from TCGA-STAD and TCGA-UCEC
